# Version 4
## Changes From Version 3:
- Defined the `printCoordMethod()` as a class method that acts on a Coordinate object and prints it
- Defined the `printCoordFunction()` as a standalone function that takes a Coordinate object as a parameter and prints it

## To Compile:
`g++ main.cpp Coordinate.cpp`

## To Run:
`./a.out`

## Notes:
- Think about if a procedure to print a coordinate point should be implemented as a method of the Coordinate class or as a standalone function...
  - It makes the most sense to implement it as a class method. Why?
