# Version 6
## Changes From Version 5:
- Defined `translate()` as a friend function of the Coordinate class

## To Compile:
`g++ main.cpp Coordinate.cpp`

## To Run:
`./a.out`

## Notes:
- Think about if it would make more sense to define `translate()` as a class method or as a standlone function (friend or otherwise). Why or why not?
