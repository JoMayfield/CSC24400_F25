# Fall 2025 CS 2 Code

This GitHub repository contains all of the code we've written together as a class. It is meant to serve as a reference as you study and practice coding on your own. I comment all code before posting, so it should make some of the material we've covered easier to follow.

This is also a good place to check when/if you miss class, in addition to our course's Canvas.
